He said the way my blue eyes shined put those Georgia stars to shame that night. I said, "that's a lie."
When you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think of me.
I promise that you'll never find another like me.
Hey kids, spelling is fun!
Me-hee-hee, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
You should've said no, you should've gone home. You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go.
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me.
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man.
'Cause if I was a man, I'd be the man.
Meet me at midnight.
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me.
Get it off your chest, get it off my desk.
My name is Taylor, and I was born in 1989!
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream, it's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city, and all you're ever gonna be is mean.
All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life, and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean.
And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game, with that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening.
Hey Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
I can see you standing, honey, with his arms around your body. Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all.
I think I've seen this film before, and I didn't like the ending.
I can see you standing, honey, like he's just your understudy, like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me.
I gave so many signs.
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights, busy streets and busy lives.
And I never saw you coming, and I'll never be the same.
Up in your room and our slates are clean. Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes.
This is a state of grace. This is the worthwhile fight. Love is a ruthless game, unless you play it good and right.
This is the golden age of something good and right and real.
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did!
He was a moth to the flame; she was holding the matches.
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things.
She took him faster than you could say 'sabotage'.
We were in the backseat, drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar.
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends. I'd never walk Cornelia Street again.
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name.
Barefoot in the kitchen, sacred new beginnings that became my religion. Listen... I hope I never lose you.
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car.
Our song is the slamming screen door, sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window. When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know.
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have.
I've heard every album, listened to the radio, waited for something to something to come along that was as good as our song.
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin and I wrote down our song.
That's when, when I wake up in the morning. That's when, when it's sunny or storming."
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January.
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close, forever and ever?
You're my, my, my, my lover.
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? With every guitar string scar on my hand, I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover.
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue. All's well that ends well to end up with you.
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me. And at every table, I'll save you a seat.
Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom, but I think it's 'cause of me.
You heard the rumors from Inez, you can't believe a word she says most times, but this time it was true.
But if I just showed up at your party, would you have me? Would you want me?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything, but I know I miss you.
So I showed up at your party. Yeah, I showed up at your party.
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?
But I know I miss you, standing in your cardigan, kissin' in my car again stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you.
Drew looks at me. I fake a smile so he won't see that I want and I'm needin' everything that we should be.
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right. I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar; the only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishin' star.
So I drive home alone. As I turn out the light, I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight.
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy. I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me.
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive.
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn.
There's no time for tears, I'm just sitting here planning my revenge.
And if you come around saying sorry to me, my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be.
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself -- 'cause coming back around here would be bad for your health.
Nice to meet you, where you been? I could show you incredible things.
Magic, madness, heaven, sin.
Love's a game, wanna play?
So hey, let's be friends, I'm dying to see how this one ends.
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames.
Stolen kisses, pretty lies, you're the king, baby, I'm your queen.
I've got a blank space, baby, and I'll write your name.
Find out what you want, be that girl for a month. But the worst is yet to come -- oh no!
Screaming, crying, perfect storms.
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream.
Boys only want love if it's torture, don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya.
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained.
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there, in the middle of the parking lot.
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair, absentmindedly makin' me want you.
And I don't know how it gets better than this. You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless.
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless.
Down the block there's an antique shop and something in my head said 'stop', so I walked in.
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944, and you were headed off to fight in the war, you still would've been mine, we would've been timeless.
So even in a different life, you still would've been mine, we would've been timeless.
If I first saw your face in the 1500s up in a foreign land, and I was forced to marry another man, you still would've been mine, we would've been timeless. I would've read your love letters every single night, and run away and left it all behind.
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know. You're always gonna be mine.
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny.
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche.
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen. She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything.
There goes the last great American dynasty.
They say she was seen on occasion, pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea. And in a feud with her neighbor, she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green.
Fifty years is a long time. Holiday House sat quietly on that beach, free of women with madness, their men and bad habits -- and then it was bought by me.
I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything.
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes, I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this. I hosted parties and starved my body like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss. The jokes weren't funny, I took the money, my friends from home don't know what to say. I looked around in a blood-soaked gown and I saw something they can't take away.
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned; everything you loes is a step you take.
So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it, you've got no reason to be afraid.
You're on your own, kid. Yeah, you can face this.
And there's nothing like a mad woman; what a shame she went mad.
Now I breathe flames each time I talk, my cannons all firing at your yacht.
It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together.
Ratatatatatatatatatatata!
They say I did something bad, then why's it feel so good?
The never see it coming, what I do next. This is how the world works, you gotta leave before you get left.
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothing. And if he spends my change, then he had it coming.
We were both young when I first saw you, I close my eyes and the flashback starts: I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
So I sneak out to the garaden to see you. We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew. So close your eyes, escape this town for a litle while.
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult, but it's real.
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone. I love you, and that's all I really know.
And I keep my side of the street clean, you wouldn't know what I mean.
Karma is my boyfriend. Karma is a god. Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend. Karma's a relaxing thought. Aren't you envious that for you, it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat purring in my lap 'cause it loves me.
Ask me what I learned from all those years, ask me what I earned from all those tears. Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here.
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street.
Losing him was blue like I'd never known; missing him was dark gray, all alone; forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met. But loving him was red.
I want you to know, I'm a mirrorball. I'll show you every version of yourself tonight.
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why. I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try.
Vintage tee, brand new phone. High heels on cobblestones.
When you are young, they assume you know nothing.
But I knew you, dancin' in your Levi's, drunk under a streetlight.
But I knew you, playing hide-and-seek and giving me your weekends.
I knew you, your heartbeat on the High Line, once in twenty lifetimes.
You drew stars around my scars, but now I'm bleedin'.
'Cause I knew you, steppin' on the last train, marked me like a bloodstain. I knew you, tried to change the ending, Peter losing Wendy. I knew you, leavin' like a father, running like water.
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time, chasin' shadows in the grocery line.
No proof, not much, but you saw enough.
You can hear it in the silence, you can feel it on the way home, you can see it with the lights out.
You two are dancing in a snowglobe 'round and 'round, and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown. And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars, and why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words.
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how. I've never heard silence quite this loud.
Can I ask you a question? Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight when she said it was too much? Do you wish you could still touch her? It's just a question.
Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike?
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace.
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake? Cursing my name, wishing I stayed, look at how my tears ricochet.
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean: some to throw, some to make a diamond ring.
And I can go anywhere I want, anywhere I want, just not home.
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood, but you would still miss me in your bones.
And I still talk to you, when I'm screaming at the sky. And when you can't sleep at night, you hear my stolen lullabies.
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves.
People like you always want back the love the gave away, and people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed.
Hey, all you had to do was stay. Had me in the palm of your hand then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside, but people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye.
